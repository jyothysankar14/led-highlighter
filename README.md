# Individually Addressable LED Highlighter

This project highlights a book using NeoPixel LEDs when a user searches for the book name. It's powered by a Raspberry Pi and a Flask-based API. Each book is mapped to a specific LED position and subject-based color.

## 📌 Features
- Python + Flask backend
- WS2812 LED Strip controlled via GPIO18
- Highlights book position with color-coded LEDs
- Supports multiple subjects

## 🧠 Subjects Covered
- Signals and Systems
- Linear Integrated Circuits
- Control Systems
- Microwaves and Antennas
- Wireless Communication

## ⚙️ Hardware Used
- Raspberry Pi (e.g., Pi 2 B+)
- WS2812 (NeoPixel) LED Strip
- Power supply (5V, sufficient current for LEDs)
- Jumper wires

## 💾 Software Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- neopixel (Adafruit WS281x Python library)
- RPi.GPIO or board for pin access
